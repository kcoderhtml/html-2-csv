### Convert HTML to CSV and JSON

html-2-csv is a personal hobby project that allows you to convert HTML soup into CSV and JSON formats. It's a fun experiment that might not work with other data, but (dare I say the dreaded words), it worked on my machine!

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python and the required dependencies (io, csv, and json) installed.
2. Run the `mega_parser.py` script.
3. Follow the prompts to save the data to several formates.
4. The parser will convert your disorganized HTML (only if it is in the same format as my data) into slightly more organized CSV and JSON files.

## Features

- Convert HTML soup into CSV and JSON files.
- Includes deduplication to get rid of duplicates.
- A one-person show, built mostly offline over vacation because I was bored
